Machine Learning ( ML) is basically the field of computer science, with the aid of which computer systems can make data meaningful in much the same way as human beings do. In simple terms, ML is a type of artificial intelligence that extracts patterns from raw data using an algorithm or method. The main focus of ML is to allow computer systems to learn from experience without specifically programming or human intervention.
